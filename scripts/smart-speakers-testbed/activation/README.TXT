Tagged activations (i.e., subset of captures) are created here
by the tag-camera and tag-activation scripts.

Each activation correspond to a directory having the name of the
video file from the source material, the starting time of the activation,
the ending time of the activation, the device that has been activated,
the detection method, and an arbitrary tag.

Each activation contains a subset of the source material (video and subtitle), 
of the camera capture, of the traffic capture for the specified device, and the
time of the activation both absolute terms and relative terms.
